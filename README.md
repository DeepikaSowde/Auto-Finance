# Auto Finance / Loan Management

Frontend: React + Vite. Backend: Express + SQLite (see [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)).

## Running locally

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API + database
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend expects the API at `http://localhost:4000/api` by default;
override with `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (see `.env.example`).

Log in with `admin` / `admin123` (admin) or `staff` / `staff123` (staff).

Customers, vehicles, loans, repayment schedules, collections and login are
served by the API and stored in SQLite. Expenses, investors, re-loan rules and
the ledger view still use browser storage for now.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
